To test program:
	<make> will compile program to executable "hw7"

	<make natural>,<make clamped>,<make nak> will run 
	each individual algoright and produce the spline 
	results to stdout

	<make nak_sparameters>,<make natural_sparameters>,
	<make clamped_sparameters> will generate splines for the
	specific algorithm and then direct to sparameters?.txt file

	<make all_spline> will generate splines for each algorigthm
	and directs splines to sparamters?.txt files

	
	<make nak_eval>,<make natural_eval>,<make clamped_eval>
	will read the splines from sparameters?.txt, and data
	points from eval.txt and evaluate that point using the
	provided splines.

	*******************************************************
	<make all_eval> is the only target that NEEDS to be run, 
	it will targer <make all_splines> to generate all of the 
	splines, and it will then evaluate the points from eval.txt
	and redirect output to eresults?.txt
